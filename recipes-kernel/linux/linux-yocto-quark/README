This folder contains Linux kernel configs that are selected/commented when
a specific DISTRO choice is selected in build/local.conf. The list of DISTRO
supported is (as the name of sub-folder suggests):
 - iot-devkit
 - iot-devkit-spi

The default Linux kernel configs chosen (per DISTRO) are vastly different.
The main reason for such is to make sure Linux kernel and rootfs size for
DISTRO=iot-devkit-spi is sufficiently small to fit into the on-board SPI flash.
